% extrinsicsToCameraPose Convert extrinsics into camera pose
%   [orientation, location] = extrinsicsToCameraPose(rotationMatrix, translationVector)
%   returns a 3-by-3 camera orientation matrix and a 1-by-3 location vector 
%   in the world coordinates. rotationMatrix is a 3-by-3 matrix and 
%   translationVector is a 3-element vector representing rotation and 
%   translation from world coordinates into camera coordinates. The outputs
%   are computed as follows:
% 
%   orientation = rotationMatrix'
%   location    = -translationVector * rotationMatrix'
% 
%   Class Support
%   -------------
%   rotationMatrix and translationMatrix must be of the same class, and can be
%   double or single. orientation and location are the same class as 
%   rotationMatrix and translationMatrix.
% 
%   Example
%   -------
%   R = eye(3);
%   t = [0 0 -10];
%   [orientation, location] = extrinsicsToCameraPose(R, t)
